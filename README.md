# Randomizing Groups Simulator: Constraint-Based Team Allocation

A fast, constraint-aware team generator for classes, events, and other team-building activities. Define participants and incompatibility rules; generate balanced groups with a randomized backtracking engine and instant, in-browser results.

## Features
- **Constraint satisfaction**: keep incompatible participants apart (unless no valid solution exists).
- **Fast generation**: randomized backtracking with early pruning; responsive with large rosters.
- **Balance**: the # of people in groups are balanced whenever possible, even with constraints. 
- **Flexible setup**: custom group sizes, number of groups, and constraints.
- **Clean UI**: add/edit participants, upload list of participants, run, review results, and export.
